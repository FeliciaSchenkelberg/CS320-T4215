Journal Assignment: Eight

In this assignment, I will reflect on the work done in previous projects. Reflection is a valuable skill for learning. It will help add an environment in which I can use to refresh my memory when reviewing my portfolio in the future.

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code, program, or software is secure by identifying the ideal product architecture. The ideal product architecture is based on specified requirements. As well as, parameters such as risk assessment, product durability, modularity of design, budget, and time constraints 

Testing can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional. This stage reports, monitors and corrects product defects until the product reaches predetermined quality standards.

2. How do I interpret the needs of users and integrate them into a program?

I can interpret the needs of the users and incorporate them into my program by planning and performing a requirement analysis. 

Requirements analysis is the most important step in SDLC. This information is used to design the core project approach and conduct a product feasibility study in the financial, business, and technical sectors. 

3. How do I approach software design?

I typically approach software design using the SDLC process. This detailed plan describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and modify or improve specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving software quality and the overall development process. A typical software development lifecycle consists of the following:

-Design and requirements analysis
-Defining requirements
-Design of the Product Architecture
-Manufacture or development of the product
-Test the product
-Market development and maintenance
